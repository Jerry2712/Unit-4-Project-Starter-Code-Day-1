                <p class="intro">Mac DeMarco's music is somewhat dirfferent from what I've listened to. Mac DeMarco's music is something that keeps me going in life, so I guess I would describe it as an inspiration, and I would absolutely recommend his music.</p>

                <p class="songs">Overall I think Mac DeMarco is a very inspirational person, he's an indie muscian who's made it big, and thats a very difficult thing to do as a musician.</p>
